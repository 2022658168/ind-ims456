            <h4>DREAM AMBITION</h4>
            <p>From my early age, I've harboured a passion for finance and education, and my dream ambition is to bridge these 2 fields in a meaningful way. My journey begins in the world of banking, to aspire experience and knowledge. With this experience under my belt, I plan to transition into academia, becoming a lecturer who inspires and educates the next generation of students. Teaching has always been close to my heart, as it allows me to relive my student days and impart the wisdom Iâ€™ve gathered along the way.To look into the eyes of my students and see reflections of my own journey, the curiosity, and the drive that propelled me forward. Through my dual experiences in banking and education, I aim to equip my students with both practical knowledge and a passion for lifelong learning.</p>
